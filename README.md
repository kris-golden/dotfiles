# dotfiles
This is my regularly used set of dotfiles, configs, and settings.

  * ***.aliases*** - lists all of my keyboard shortcuts.  It may call a function too.   
  * ***.functions*** - helper functions that I've created for commad line enhancement.   
  * ***.bash_prompt*** - a default prompt I've created to be used across multiple machines.  It uses .bash_local for a unique callsign.   
  * ***.bash_local_test*** - creates a unique prompt 'callsign' that I use for each different machine.  This file should be unique on each local machine and 'named .bash_local'.
